## 🎯 Next Steps: Enable GitHub Pages

### **IMPORTANT**: You need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings

Follow these steps:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**
   - Visit: https://github.com/luxestudio-live/auri-concept/settings/pages

2. **Configure Pages**
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - This will allow the workflow file to handle deployments

3. **Save and Wait**
   - The configuration saves automatically
   - The next push to `main` will trigger the deployment
   - First deployment takes 2-5 minutes

4. **Access Your Site**
   - Once deployed, your site will be live at:
   - **https://luxestudio-live.github.io/auri-concept/**

## 🔄 How Automatic Deployment Works

Every time you push to the `main` branch:

1. GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically
2. Installs dependencies with pnpm
3. Builds the Next.js site (`pnpm build`)
4. Exports static files to `/out` directory
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages
6. Site is live in 2-5 minutes!
